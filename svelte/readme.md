An intuitive Svelte component for creating content editing forms to manage data within UI elements on a page. You can use it for editing structured data like table rows, informational cards, blocks with text, etc. 

### Key features:

- **Flexible display options**: open the editor in a modal popup or as a seamless sidebar for convenient access.
- **Multiple input types**: Use various input fields like text inputs, checkboxes, date pickers, sliders, and more controls from [SVAR Svelte Core](https://svar.dev/svelte/core/) library.
- **Built-in validation**: Includes basic validation for required fields and supports custom validation rules for advanced scenarios.
- **Flexible save options**: Choose between manual saves, auto-save, or custom saving logic adjusted to your needs.
- **Compact layout**: Organize forms into expandable sections or a 2-column layout for efficient use of screen space.

### How to Use

To use the widget, simply import the package and include the component in your Svelte file:

```svelte
<script>
	import { Editor } from "wx-svelte-editor";

	const value = [];
</script>

<Editor {value} />
```

### How to Modify

Typically, you don't need to modify the code. However, if you wish to do so, follow these steps:

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies. Note that this project is a monorepo using `yarn` workspaces, so npm will not work
2. Start the project in development mode with `yarn start`

### Run Tests

To run the test:

1. Start the test examples with:
    ```sh
    yarn start:tests
    ```
2. In a separate console, run the end-to-end tests with:
    ```sh
    yarn test:cypress
    ```
